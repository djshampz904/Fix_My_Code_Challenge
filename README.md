<h1>Fix my code challenge</h1>
<p>My code is a mess! Can you fix it?</p>

Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and <i><b><u>fix it</u></b></i>!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

Please download the repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
