# Fix My Code Challenge

This project is part of the "Fix My Code Challenge". The challenge is to jump into an existing code base and fix it. The language used in this project is Python.

## 0-fizzbuzz.py

This Python script is a simple implementation of the popular FizzBuzz problem. The script takes a number `n` as an argument and prints numbers from 1 to `n` separated by a space. 

Here are the rules it follows:

- For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, it prints "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

If no argument is provided, the script will print a usage message and exit.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./0-fizzbuzz.py <number>

```

## 1-print_square.js

This Python script prints a square with the character `#`. The size of the square is determined by the value of the `size` variable.

If `size` is not an integer, the script will raise a `TypeError` with the message `size must be an integer`.

If `size` is less than 0, the script will raise a `ValueError` with the message `size must be >= 0`.

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
./1-print_square.js <size>

```
